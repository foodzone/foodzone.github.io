                     <li> Cook the pasta in a large pan of salted boiling water according to packet instructions.
                        Meanwhile, fry the onion in a large frying pan over a medium heat in a swig of olive oil until soft and golden.
                        Increase the heat and add the chopped bacon and continue cooking for 2 mins.
                     </li><!-- list Element-->
                     <li>Add the sliced mushrooms and cook over the high heat until soft and lightly golden.
                        Add the crushed garlic and cook for a few seconds (Take care not to burn).
                        Add the Lemon Zest, Sun-dried Tomato Pur√©e and remaining white wine. Continue to cook until wine reduced by half.
                     </li>
                     <li>Combine the Ricotta, 2 Tbs of parmesan and the Lemon Juice.
                        Drain the pasta reserving a cup of the pasta water.
                        Combine the pasta with the Mushroom Bacon Mixture and add a little of the cooking water to loosen the mix. Toss to combine. Season to taste (Bacon is salty so I found adding salt unnecessary).
                     </li>
                     <li>Serve the pasta with a grating of Parmesan, generously scattered torn basil leaves and a good dollop of the Lemony Ricotta.
                        This is quite a quick process once the cooking begins so you will need to prepare, chop and measure all ingredients to begin with. It should really serve 6 (normal people) but in my family it would feed 4 super hungry adults!
                     </li>
